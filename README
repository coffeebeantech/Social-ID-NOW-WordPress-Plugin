**Embeding a Social-ID**

> You can embed your Social-ID by knowing your numeric ID. To get this, just login to your account and go to [Your Social-ID preferences page](http://www.socialidnow.com/users/edit "Social-ID Preferences")

> Once you get your numeric ID, use the syntax below to include it within content
>
> `[social_id id=17]`
>
> Or this syntax to include it within your PHP code
>
> `SocialID::social_id(17);`

**Embeding a group**

> You can embed your Social-ID group by knowing it's URL name. You can tell this by looking at the group's URL. For example, for the group http://www.socialidnow.com/groups/coffeebean , the URL name is coffeebean.

> Once you know the URL name, use the syntax below to include it within content
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean]`
>
> Or this sytnax to include it within your PHP code
>
> `SocialID::social_id_group("coffeebean");`

**Changing width and height**
> You can choose from three different layouts by using the syntax below
> 
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean size=normal]`
>
> The possible values are:
>
> *small*: Shows the title and pictures only.
>
> *normal*: Shows group image and description with people pictures.
>
> *large*: Shows group image, description and a badge for each person. 


**Customizing the look**
> You can use several parameters to choose how your embed will look like. They are
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean header=no]`
> This will hide the header with the group image and description
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean join_button=no]`
> If the group is open this will hide the Join button that would normally show
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean join_button_position=middle]`
> If the group is open and the Join Button is showing, this parameter will define where the button goes. The possible values are: top, middle, bottom.
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean pictures=no]`
> Hides all the pictures, leaving only the header and group image
>
> `[social_id_group group_url=coffeebean width=600 height=400]`
> This will change the width and height to specified values
